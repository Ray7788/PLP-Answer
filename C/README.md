COMP26020 Part1: C Formative Answer
=========
Here is the raw exercise [website](https://olivierpierre.github.io/comp26020/), you can also visit the question [Repo](https://github.com/olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/tree/2022-2023)

* Please note there is no week5 exercise in 2022-2023. but the command for checking the correctness of your program includes "week5", it is obviously wrong.

  For example :

  ```
  check50 -l --ansi-log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/2022-2023/week5-compilation/01-macro
  ```

  You need to change it manually to: 
  ```
  check50 -l --ansi-log olivierpierre/comp26020-problems/2022-2023/week4-compilation/01-macro
  ```

* There are also some wrong markinbg scripts, sometimes you need to judge them by yourself!
